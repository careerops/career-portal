                <p>At <strong>Career Opportunities Online</strong>, we value transparency. We are a boutique recruitment network connecting global talent with specialized US and International opportunities.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-corp-blue">1. How We Use Your Data</h3>
                <p>The information you submit (Resume, Contact Info, Skill Assessment) is used solely for recruitment purposes. We do not sell your data to third-party marketers or spam lists.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-corp-blue">2. Our Partner Network</h3>
                <p>We operate as a network of hiring partners. By applying, you understand and agree that:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Your profile may be reviewed by multiple hiring managers within our partner ecosystem (Logistics, Promo, and Support firms).</li>
                    <li>If the specific role you applied for is filled, we may match your profile with a Partner Agency that has a similar opening.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefit to You:</strong> This significantly increases your chances of placement. If one client role is closed, another partner may review your profile and reach out to you directly via our network.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-corp-blue">3. Data Retention & Future Contact</h3>
                <p>We maintain a secure talent database. Business needs change rapidly; a role that is closed today might reopen next month with a new client. By applying, you agree that we may contact you via email or WhatsApp in the future regarding new opportunities that match your skill set.</p>
